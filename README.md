## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Boostrap

### What I learned

I learned it is much better to plan ahead of any projects, do basic sketch, choose classes for each elements in the layout and how you'd implement it before starting to write code as doing this saves you a lot of time.


### Continued development

I would like to be better at better web development practices, less repitiion and also get better at responsive designs
